#TASK

#Two suggested optimisations for the algorithm to calculate the divisors of a number are to initalise the divisors
#tuple to include 1 and the number itself and to only search from 2 and as far as half of the number. Revise
#the solution on Pages 14â€“17 of the slides to include these optimisations.
#investigate whether further optimisations can be made 


#PSEUDOCODE                 #utilising material from lecture 16 as a base, as per instructions

#create function FindDivisors 
    #create tuple 'Divisors' to already contain 1, num
    #iterate through range - starting from 2, finishing on half the number +1 
        #if num1 and num2 can both be evenly divided by the current number in the range: 
            #add the current number to the list of divisors 
    #return divisor list 

#request user to input a positive number 
#repeat request for user to input a positive number 

#if either number is less than/equal to zero: 
    #print message that the numbers should be greater than 0. 
#else 
    #print the divisors, using a function call 
    #using sum function to find the total of divisors
