#TASK
#In Python, a segment (substring) of a string is called a slice. Selecting a slice is done in a similar way to selecting a character, for example:
# a n i m a l s = ' h e r d o f e l e p h a n t s '
# s e g = a n i m a l s [ x : y ]
# p r i n t ( ' Segment i s : ' , s e g )
# where x and y are replaced by integers (indexes). Experiment with different values of x and y. For example:
# (a) What happens when x and y are the same?

food = 'donut' 
seg = food [5:5] #Attempted this with a couple of different integers, it did not return any result 
print ('Segment is:', seg)

#(b) What happens when x is greater than y?

county = 'dublin' 
seg = county [3:2] #Attempted this with different integer combinations, did not return any result 
print ('Segment is:', seg)

#(c) What happens when x is omitted?

country = 'ireland'
seg = country [:2]
print ('Segment is:', seg) #This returned 'ir'.

#(d) What happens when y is omitted?

plant = 'shamrock'
seg = plant [3:] 
print ('Segment is:', seg) #This returned 'mrock'.

#(e) What happens when both x and y are omitted?

device = 'laptop'
seg = device [:] #This returned 'laptop'.
print ('Segment is:', seg)
