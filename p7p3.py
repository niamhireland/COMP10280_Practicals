#Using the while loop to print out first 50 integers, printing out each number and the square of the number. 
#First establish a count and number 
#While count is less than/equal to 50, then:
    #number=current count number +1
    #print(current number, what the number is when squared)
    #count =+1 and loop resumes
    #loop will terminate when count reaches 50

while count<=50:
