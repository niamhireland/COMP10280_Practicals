#TASK
#A string in Python is a sequence of characters. You can access the characters one at a time using the index, an expression in square brackets. 
#The index indicates which letter is required from the string. For example, consider the following code segment:
# a n im a l = ' e l e p h a n t '
# l e t t e r = a n im a l [ 1 ]
# Use different values for the index and use the print command to print out the individual letters selected. Ensure that you understand the behaviour of the indexing. 
#Submit examples of your experiementation.

#Using the index to print an acrostic word
animal = "elephant"
letter = animal[4]
print (letter)

#Using the index a second time 
flower = "daisy"
selection = flower[1]
print (selection)

#A third attempt at using the index 
subject = "CompSci"
vowel = subject[2]
print (vowel)
