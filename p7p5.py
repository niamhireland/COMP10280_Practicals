#Write a program that sums the integers in the range 1â€“10 000 that are divisble by 3 or by 5 and prints out the total

    #Let sum = current count +0
    #if sum is divisible by 3, add it to div_3
    #if sum is divisible by 5, add it to div_5
    #add 1 to current count
    #add sums in div_3 and div_5
    #print result with 'Total is" before sum result

count=1 #count of numbers
